# **LIBFT**

This project aims to teach students how to create their own first library.

To do so we create our own implementation of some libc functions, and some additional functions.

# Disclaimer

If you're a **Codam**/**42 school** student I encourage you try this project on your own before looking at somebody else's code.

Also I would recommend to only check other people's work wisely.
