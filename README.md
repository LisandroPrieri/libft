# **LIBFT**

This project aims to teach students how to create their own first library.

To do so we create our own implementation of some libc functions, and of some additional functions.

# Disclaimer

If you're a **Codam**/**42 school** student I encourage you do this project on your own.

Only check other people's work wisely. Good reasons would for instance be when you're looking for inspiration, when you have to evaluate a project and want to have an idea of what the code might look like or when you would just like to compare it with your own work.
